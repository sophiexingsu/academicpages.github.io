About Me
=====
I am currently working as a Reserach Assisant at  <a href="https://haskinslabs.org/">Haskins Lab</a> (PI: <a href="https://landi.lab.uconn.edu/"> Dr.Nicole Landi</a>).
<br><br>
I graduated from Cornell University in fall 2019 with a degree in Economics and Psyhcology. My honors thesis explored the relationship between goal/action change perception, event segmentation and perspectives. 




Research Interest
======
How do people extract useful information from the world that is filled with noises, ambiguity and flux, and make decisions? From career paths to which button to press in a psychology experiment, decision making is ubiquitous and fundamental. A variety of economics and psychological models have been proposed, but a computational model of adaptive decision-making that accounts for both behavioral and neural data remains elusive. I would like to characterize this process using a combination of behavior studies, computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques and build psychologically meaningful and biologically plausible
models?
